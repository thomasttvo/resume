I interviewed and hired the other two outside of Toptal. - Took over a codebase with high technical debt from an outsourced party and rebuilt the team from the ground up, putting agile practices and lean software development culture in place. Worked with QA engineers to stabilize the product, resolving numerous technical issues and implementing new features. - Rebuilt the infrastructure of the React Native app, cleaning up thousands of lines of repetitive code while establishing a strong foundation for future development. Orchestrated the rest of the team to build new features on top of this infrastructure. - Handled the migration of server-side architecture from Express, Firebase Functions, and Firestore to Apollo, Heroku, and MongoDB Atlas, resulting in better extensibility, security, and simplified logic. - Planned and held regular product meetings to ensure effective collaboration among product, design, and development teams. This facilitated maximum product impact and minimum development effort while promoting high ownership of various product parts among team members. - Built from scratch a form manager library (using XState) that generates a form based on a simple JSON object and abstracts out all complex logic like state management, validation, formatting, submitting, loading animation, and more. - Developed numerous features for both React Web and React Native, and wrote unit tests using Jest, Testing Library, and Enzyme. - Optimized individual end-to-end test cases (built with WebdriverIO) and built a system leveraging AWS Device Farm to split end-to-end tests into 50 instances, cutting down test time from 40 minutes to 7 minutes.

Created a concurrency system to sync users' offline data across multiple devices. - Migrated all of the AngularJS components from the web app to React Native while rewriting ZERO lines of controller code. - Used data analytics to identify and rewrite several MongoDB queries with performance issues. - Created a roommate-matching algorithm based on 22 different lifestyle qualities. Built a dynamic form wizard where each step adapts to answers in the previous steps. The wizard engine is decoupled enough to be reused on both React Native and Angular. - Built several admin features on React including data charts (with Highcharts), CRMs, and user management. - Developed from scratch a simpler alternative to Redux but highly tailored to the current system. - Developed financial models, laid out business strategy, raised funding, and participated in strategic investor meetings. - Designed from scratch the UI/UX, and branding of the product with Sketch and, later on, led the product design team. - Developed Tableau charts connected to MongoDB to perform data analytics resulting in 2x the GMV of the marketplace.
