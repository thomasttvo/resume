      content: `Possessing both a creative and a logical mind, Thomas is passionate about building practical, well-designed, scalable, and financially sustainable products that impact millions of lives by improving their well-being.

Thomas attended Georgia Tech and dropped out after the sophomore year to join a startup and quickly became a senior engineer 2 years later. After working at major technology companies like Weather.com, CafePress, and ADP, Thomas went on to start his own startup where he built the product, raised funding, recruited the team, and grew the company to 300k users.

Having grown up in a financially-challenged family in Vietnam and, later on, experienced cultural and social challenges when his family moved to the US, Thomas is driven to transform society and create opportunities for students and professionals to develop mentally and intellectually.

As an engineer, Thomas values testable, reusable, performant, secure, and self-documented code. Most of the time, this boils down to mastery of SOLID principles and design patterns.

As a leader, Thomas values building wholesome company cultures, developing compassionate leadership, investing in communication, and prioritizing mental/physical well-being of team members

- Rebuilt from scratch the infrastructure of the React Native app to clean up thousands of lines of repetitive code while creating a strong baseline for the future development plan and orchestrated the rest of the team to build new features on top.
- Built from scratch a form generator system that handles all form-related user experience including loading, validating, keyboard events, submission, alerts, and error handling.
- Orchestrated the migration of server-side architecture from Express, Firebase Functions, and Firestore to Apollo GraphQL, Heroku, and MongoDB Atlas to allow for a more flexible and simplified code base.
- Orchestrated the development from scratch and fine-tuning of the web platform
- Collaborated with a Toptal designer, a Toptal product manager to orchestrate the dev team to implement a total make-over of the product based on user feedback from v1.0 while creating a more consistent atomic design system.
- Planned and held product meetings to ensure three-way feedbacks among product, design, and dev for maximum product impact and minimum dev effort, while also steering each member of the dev team toward high ownership of various parts of the product.
- Maintained the development process and constantly made iterative changes to the process to tailor-fit to the team and the circumstances rather than adhering strictly to existing agile frameworks.`,

- Moved the original application from BackPress to Yii Framework (www.yiiframework.com) for better component organization and putting more focus into solid architecture and security.

In 2013:

- On the server side: Customized Yii Framework to add support for enterprise development: Dependency Injection, Aspect Oriented Programming, Two Step View Layout, Service Layer (Transaction Script Implementation), and JSON Web Service inspired by the Patterns of Service Oriented Web Application by Martin Fowler.
- On the client side: Used AngularJs and RequireJS to create a fully enterprise ready javascript application that transcend what's provided by jQuery.`,
