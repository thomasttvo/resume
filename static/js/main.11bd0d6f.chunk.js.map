millions of lives by improving their well-being.\n\nThomas attended Georgia Tech and dropped out after the sophomore year to join a startup and quickly became a senior engineer 2 years later. After working at major technology companies like Weather.com, CafePress, and ADP, Thomas went on to start his own startup where he built the product, raised funding, recruited the team, and grew the company to 300k users.\n\nHaving grown up in a financially-challenged family in Vietnam and, later on, experienced cultural and social challenges when his family moved to the US, Thomas is driven to transform society and create opportunities for students and professionals to develop mentally and intellectually.\n\nAs an engineer, Thomas values testable, reusable, performant, secure, and self-documented code. Most of the time, this boils down to mastery of SOLID principles and design patterns.\n\nAs a leader, Thomas values building wholesome company cultures, developing compassionate leadership, investing in communication, prioritizing mental/physical well-being of team members\n\nPrimary experience: complex client-side Javascript systems (React, React Native, Angular)\nPreferred process: In general, Agile Manifesto over Agile Frameworks\nPreferred company categories: B2C, media, finance, data, marketplaces\nPreferred work environment: wholesome, mission-driven, work-life balance, promoting healthy lifestyle, social, communicative, challenging the status quo.\n`,\n    },\n\n    skills: {\n      title: 'Skills',\n      content: [\n        ['React Web', 'React Native', 'AngularJS', 'HTML/CSS', 'MongoDB', 'NodeJS', 'Tableau', 'Sketch'],\n        [\n          'Software Architecture',\n          'OOD',\n          'OOP',\n          'Data Analytics',\n          'Design',\n          'Leadership',\n          'Lean Startup',\n          'Product Management',\n        ],\n      ],\n    },\n\n    experience: {\n      title: 'Experience',\n      content: [\n        {\n          title: 'Engineering Manager',\n          company: 'Dormzi LLC.',\n          start: 'Jun 2019',\n          location: 'United States (Remote)',\n          skills: [\n            ['React Web', 'React Native', 'MongoDB', 'XState'],\n            ['Apollo GraphQL', 'Firebase', 'Firestore'],\n          ],\n          description: `- Managed a remote team of five senior engineers (two software engineers in test) distributed across the US, Europe, and Asia.\n- Interviewed and participated in the decision to hire multiple team members including the CTO and the current product manager.\n- Took over a codebase with a high amount of technical debt from an outsourced party, rebuilt the team, put in place agile practices and lean software development culture, worked with a QA engineer to stabilize the product, and successfully launched v1.0.\n- Rebuilt from scratch the infrastructure of the React Native app to clean up thousands of lines of repetitive code while creating a strong baseline for the future development plan and orchestrated the rest of the team to build new features on top.\n- Built from scratch a form generator system that handles all form-related user experience including loading, validating, keyboard events, submission, alerts, and error handling.\n- Orchestrated the migration of server-side architecture from Express, Firebase Functions, and Firestore to Apollo GraphQL, Heroku, and MongoDB Atlas to allow for a more flexible and simplified code base.\n- Orchestrated the development from scratch and fine-tuning of the web platform\n- Collaborated with a Toptal designer, a Toptal product manager to orchestrate the dev team to implement a total make-over of the product based on user feedback from v1.0 while creating a more consistent atomic design system.\n- Planned and held product meetings to ensure three-way feedbacks among product, design, and dev for maximum product impact and minimum dev effort, while also steering each member of the dev team toward high ownership of various parts of the product.\n- Maintained the development process and constantly made iterative changes to the process to tailor-fit to the team and the circumstances rather than adhering strictly to existing agile frameworks.`,\n        },\n        {\n          title: 'Co-founder & CTO',\n          company: 'Ohana',\n          start: 'Jan 2017',\n          end: 'Jul 2020',\n          location: 'Vietnam & Singapore',\n          skills: [\n            [\n              'React Web',\n              'React Native',\n              'AngularJS',\n              'ExpressJS',\n              'MongoDB',\n              'Highcharts',\n              'Firebase',\n              'Sketch',\n              'Tableau',\n            ],\n          ],\n          description: `- Founded and managed the entire product team of the most advanced apartment marketplace in Vietnam (Airbnb-like, for residential rentals) on React/React Native.
