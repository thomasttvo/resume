financially sustainable products that impact millions of lives by improving their well-being.\n\nThomas attended Georgia Tech and dropped out after the sophomore year to join a startup and quickly became a senior engineer 2 years later. After working at major technology companies like Weather.com, CafePress, and ADP, Thomas went on to start his own startup where he built the product, raised funding, recruited the team, and grew the company to 300k users.\n\nHaving grown up in a financially-challenged family in Vietnam and, later on, experienced cultural and social challenges when his family moved to the US, Thomas is driven to transform society and create opportunities for students and professionals to develop mentally and intellectually.\n\nAs an engineer, Thomas values testable, reusable, performant, secure, and self-documented code. Most of the time, this boils down to mastery of SOLID principles and design patterns.\n\nAs a leader, Thomas values building wholesome company cultures, developing compassionate leadership, investing in communication, prioritizing mental/physical well-being of team members\n\nPrimary experience: complex Javascript systems (React, React Native, Angular)\nPreferred process: In general, Agile Manifesto over Agile Frameworks\nPreferred company categories: B2C, media, finance, data, marketplaces\nPreferred work environment: wholesome, mission-driven, work-life balance, promoting healthy
